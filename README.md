We all take hundreds of photos and sometimes it is difficult to remember the event and who was with us. There will also be an
    - where text
    - description what the event was
    - time stamp
(photo on left: data on the right)

- Who is for? (e.g. Students who are studying for the MCAT)
      It is for family, friends
